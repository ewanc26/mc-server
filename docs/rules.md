# Ewan's Minecraft Server Rules

The main rule is to just not be a dick, but just to clarify:

## 1. Respect everyone on the server, that means

- if you feel like an argument is gonna break out, step away from the situation  
- even if you say it's a joke, respect the person's wishes if they don't like it  
- don't go fucking around with people - if you wouldn't do it to me, don't do it to anyone else

## 2. Don't say anything in chat that directly attacks someone or a specific group, that's just stupid

- No slurs, homophobia, or other derogatory terms in chat, signs, books, or builds

## 3. Don't share the server IP or invite people without asking me first

- if you want to invite someone, just message me so I can add them to the whitelist  
- this server is only for friends - keep it that way

## 4. Don't grief, steal, or mess with other people's builds without permission

- This includes taking items from chests, destroying builds, or "pranking" without consent
- If you're not sure if something belongs to someone, ask first

## 5. Keep your builds appropriate

- No offensive structures, inappropriate pixel art, or anything that violates these rules
- Use common sense about what's acceptable

## 6. Don't cry to me for OP privileges

- The people who currently have them have my trust and experience
- Asking repeatedly won't change my mind

## 7. Follow Minecraft's EULA and be respectful of the server resources

- Don't create lag machines or exploit glitches maliciously
- Report any serious bugs or issues you find

## 8. Don't expose personal information about yourself or other players

- Obviously accidents happen, but deliberately sharing someone's personal info with intent to harm will result in an instant ban

## 9. Use your common sense

- If it seems wrong, it probably is
- When in doubt, ask

Remember: This is a private server for friends to have fun together. Let's keep it that way!
